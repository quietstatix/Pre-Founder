# Rethinking Purple Teaming for Decentralized Systems

## Summary
“Purple team” is often defined as a collaboration between red-team attackers and
blue-team defenders. In practice, it usually becomes a workshop or a combined
exercise. For decentralized, privacy-first, and community-governed systems, this
definition is too shallow.

A real purple capability should function as an *intelligence layer* that
understands adversarial behavior, insider threats, and socio-technical drift.

## Limitations of the Traditional Model
Most purple-team activity does not address:

- long-game infiltration or insider threat behavior  
- governance capture attempts  
- social-engineering patterns inside communities  
- adversarial psychology  
- trust boundary erosion over time  
- manipulation of consensus or culture  
- decentralization-specific vulnerabilities  

Decentralized systems face these threats constantly.

## Purple as an Intelligence Layer
A more complete purple capability would provide:

1. **Adversarial Insight**  
   Models attacker reasoning, deception, and adaptation over time.

2. **Insider Threat Modeling**  
   Identifies how long-term actors may masquerade as trusted contributors.

3. **Governance Stress Testing**  
   Simulates factionalism, quorum manipulation, and capture attempts.

4. **Trust Drift Detection**  
   Detects slow erosion of norms, ethics, and safety practices.

5. **Anti-Deception Design**  
   Anticipates manipulative behavior at social and protocol levels.

6. **Decentralization-Aware Defense**  
   Protects systems without introducing central points of failure.

## Relevance to NGI and Federated Projects
Open-source communities face unique risks:

- concentrated maintainer power  
- charismatic manipulators  
- covert forks with hidden agendas  
- burnout-driven governance collapse  
- subtle shifts in project culture  

These cannot be solved by red or blue teams alone.

A purple intelligence layer strengthens:

- zero-retention trust models  
- multi-signature governance  
- decentralized onboarding  
- ethical invariants  
- transparent decision-making

## Purpose
This note proposes an evolution of purple teaming suitable for distributed,
privacy-first ecosystems. Feedback, critique, and alternative models are
welcome.
