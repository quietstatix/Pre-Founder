<p align="center">
A research prototype exploring anonymous, hardware-bound onboarding for decentralized systems.
</p>

---

### Overview

**pre-founder-channel** is an open research effort focused on creating a safe, privacy-first protocol for onboarding trusted participants into decentralized systems **without identity**, **without in-person verification**, and **without centralized authorities**.

This repository contains early documentation, design notes, and reference materials for:

- decentralized trust models  
- hardware-based attestation  
- anonymous role activation  
- local-first cryptographic vetting  
- multi-sig approval pipelines  
- bootstrap → stable governance transitions  
- anti-capture governance tooling

### Current Research Focus

**Anonymous Hardware-Attested Onboarding**

A novel method for:

- verifying a participant’s hardware  
- issuing encrypted role packages  
- establishing a behavioral trust baseline (local-only)  
- activating trusted roles via anonymous multi-sig  
- preventing organizational capture or infiltration  
- avoiding identity-based trust requirements  

All analysis, prototypes, and documents here are:

- open-source  
- privacy-preserving  
- non-commercial for individuals, students, and small dev teams  
- intended for public benefit

### Status

This repository currently serves as a **public project anchor** for early documentation.  
Specification drafts, prototypes, and formal write-ups will be added as development continues.
