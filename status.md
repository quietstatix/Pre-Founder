# Status: Experimental — Not Safe for Deployment

This repository contains a **research-stage design** for an anonymous, 
hardware-bound onboarding protocol. It is an architectural proposal, not 
a production-ready security system. Nothing here should be used to protect 
life-critical, sensitive, or high-risk communications.

## Current State

- v0.x conceptual and architectural draft  
- No implementation  
- No audits  
- No formal proofs  
- No verified security properties  
- No safe deployment path  

## Intended Use at This Stage

- Research  
- Review  
- Critique  
- Discussion  
- Prototyping in safe environments  
- Early experimentation  

## Not Intended For

- Activist communication  
- Whistleblower workflows  
- Sensitive operations  
- Anonymous coordination under threat  
- Any real-world or life-critical use  

## Key Limitations and Open Questions

The following areas are **not complete** and **must not be assumed secure**:

- IRWIN Candidate Mode / “3+1” behavioral model  
- Local integrity heuristics  
- Secure Package composition  
- Hardware Fingerprint Bundle entropy sources  
- Multi-sig quorum selection  
- Replay, cloning, and VM boundary assumptions  
- Side-channel and behavioral security  
- Threat model completeness  
- Governance transition logic  
- Revocation flows  

## Future Steps Needed Before Deployment

- Implementation  
- Internal testing  
- Multiple independent reviews  
- Cryptanalysis and audit  
- Red-team attack attempts  
- Formal security analysis  
- Reproducible build validation  
- Community governance review  

## Ethical Notice

This protocol is intended for privacy-preserving, decentralized communities. 
It must not be assumed safe for at-risk individuals until it has undergone 
substantial testing, review, and hardening.
